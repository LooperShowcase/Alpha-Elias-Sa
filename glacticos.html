    <pre id="first">
         Galácticos (Spanish for galactics, referring to superstars) are expensive,
         world-famous football players recruited during the "galácticos" policy pursued during 
         Florentino Pérez's presidency at Real Madrid,
         where in his first tenure between 2000 and 2006 he purchased
         at least one galáctico in the summer of every year. The club's second
         galáctico era began in 2009 with Pérez's return to the presidency,
         and is considered to be more successful both economically and in terms of on-pitch achievements.

    <pre class="second">
         Although the term was popularized in the 2000s, the origins of the Galáctico policy date as 
         far back as the 1950s and 1960s, when the policy was first founded by club-president Santiago Bernabéu.
         Bernabéu signed multiple star players for large fees in quick succession, such as Alfredo Di Stéfano, Francisco Gento,
         Raymond Kopa, Héctor Rial, Ferenc Puskás and José Santamaría. This period of buying allowed
         Real Madrid to enjoy their finest era of dominance, winning twelve La Liga championships and six European Cups.
